POSIX directory stuff for Cset/2

by Joe DeRosa 3/22/93 (1:141/42@fidonet.org)

released in the public domain

if you use this code you accept ALL responsibility for anything that
happens.

These 6 routines are available on several compilers that I have used,
including several unix compilers and a couple of DOS compilers so I
decided to port them to OS/2 here they are.

They are free, but if you wish to throw money, thankyous, bugs

DIR	      *opendir (char  *dname);
struct dirent *readdir (DIR  *dir);
int	      closedir (DIR  *dir);
void	      rewinddir(DIR  *dir);
long	      telldir(DIR *dir);
void	      seekdir(DIR *dir,long loc);

For documentation see the source I don't feel like writing any.
